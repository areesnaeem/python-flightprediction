# Python flight prediction

The following case study was part of datathon conducted by sastaticket.pk to explore,clean, transform and further processing of ML modeling to predict if is it better to buy a ticket now, or wait for a better price in the future?

For the purpose of this project, following task was done for hands-on expereince:

1. Importing important libraries into .ipynb to use in EDA & Feature engineering.

2. Importing dataset into .ipynb file.

3. Performed EDA on dataset.

4. Droping unwanted columns which had no impact on analysis.

5. Performed Feature engineering steps:
    - Type casting
    - Seperating catagorical and numerical columns in specific variables

6. Visualisation based on numerical and catagorical variables.

7. Checking on abnormaliy of data along with skewness and kurtosis.

8. Transforming variables i.e. normalization of data.

9. Spliting of data into features and target.

10. Fitting of ML algorithms.

11. Uploaded the file on github for sharing.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate skills in python relted to EDA, data wrangling, feature engineering and data analysis. Through this process, we have gained valuable experience in applying data cleaning and exploration techniques to real-world data. The final product is a clean and well-structured dataset which is ready for ML modeling and futher analysis.
